The basic policy of this chapter is to allow the continuation of any nonconformity and the normal repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or improvement thereof, and to encourage their move toward conformity when the opportunity arises through discontinuance or destruction. In certain cases nonconformities may be permitted to be upgraded when it can be shown that such action will not be harmful and will be beneficial to the surrounding properties, the neighborhood, or the community; and that the goals of local plans will not be impeded by the continuation of the nonconformity.\""
